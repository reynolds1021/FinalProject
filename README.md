1) black_scholes_quantum.py
2) 2Dheatequationpde.py
3) Various Jupyter Notebook files (ext .ipynb) for the IBMQ Quantum Circuit implementation of the Database and Black-Scholes Model.

B. The Main branch contains the files necessary to run a Flask app that runs a website summarizing the files and findings above.
